## Laravel Firebase

- First, thanks to Kreait who has developed the Laravel Firebase package (https://github.com/kreait/laravel-firebase)

- Second, this is a repository that contains the basic settings for Laravel Firebase in the form of Traits. You can use it directly by changing the service JSON file in public/firebase and changing the Database URI.

- Third, a video about how to use Laravel Firebase will be uploaded on YouTube Fariqi Developer. Links will be written later.
